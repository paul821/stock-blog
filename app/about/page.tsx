        Welcome to Paul Analytics! 
        
        Hi, I’m Paul Kim - a rising senior at Northwestern University pursuing a double major in Industrial Engineering and Economics, complemented by the Kellogg Certificate in Managerial Analytics.

My academic and professional journey centers around one goal: to uncover actionable insights from complex systems - whether that’s through econometric modeling, optimization, or machine learning. From consulting on a $9B M&A deal at Monitor Deloitte to conducting stratified analysis of U.S. corporate debt as a research assistant, I’ve applied quantitative thinking to real-world business, financial, and organizational challenges.

I’ve used Python, SQL, and TensorFlow to predict stock volatility, classify corporate debt structures, and integrate AI into procurement pipelines. Equally comfortable working cross-functionally and communicating findings to stakeholders, I bring a mix of analytical rigor and strategic perspective.

I’m currently exploring roles in:
<li>
<ul>Consulting (operations, economic)</ul>
<ul>Quantitative finance & trading</ul>
<ul>Data science & analytics</ul>
<ul>Project and product management</ul>
  </li>

If you’re working at the intersection of data, strategy, and innovation, I’d love to connect.
