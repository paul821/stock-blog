        "This report analyzes FedEx Corporation (FDX) as an investment opportunity using a long strangle options strategy. Based on anticipated volatility driven by tariff policies and potential USPS privatization, we implemented a strategy expecting significant stock price movement in either direction. The analysis covers a period when FedEx stock decreased 10.28% over 12 months but increased 4.84% in the past month, trading within a 52-week range of $189.30 to $313.84.\n",

These factors were expected to create substantial volatility in FedEx's stock price, making it suitable for a volatility-based options strategy."
