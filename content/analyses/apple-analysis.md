# Financial Analysis

## Revenue Breakdown

Apple's revenue diversification continues to strengthen, with Services now representing 22% of total revenue. This shift toward higher-margin recurring revenue improves earnings quality and reduces cyclical volatility.

```python
# Revenue segment analysis
revenue_segments = {
    'iPhone': 200.6,
    'Mac': 29.4,
    'iPad': 26.8,
    'Wearables': 39.1,
    'Services': 85.2
}

# Calculate percentages
total_revenue = sum(revenue_segments.values())
revenue_pct = {k: (v/total_revenue)*100 for k, v in revenue_segments.items()}

print("Revenue by Segment (in billions):")
for segment, revenue in revenue_segments.items():
    print(f"{segment}: ${revenue}B ({revenue_pct[segment]:.1f}%)")
```

wacc = 0.082
shares_outstanding = 15.7  # in billions

# 5-year projections
base_revenue = 381.6  # FY2023 revenue
projected_revenues = [base_revenue * (1 + revenue_growth) ** i for i in range(1, 6)]
projected_fcf = [rev * operating_margin * 0.8 for rev in projected_revenues]  # Tax adjustment

print("5-Year Free Cash Flow Projections:")
for year, fcf in enumerate(projected_fcf, 1):
    print(f"Year {year}: ${fcf:.1f}B")

current_price = 175
volatility = 0.25
time_horizon = 1  # 1 year

# Run simulation
final_prices = []
for _ in range(num_simulations):
    random_return = random.gauss(0.11, volatility)  # 11% expected return
    final_price = current_price * (1 + random_return)
    final_prices.append(final_price)

# Calculate probabilities
prob_positive = sum(1 for price in final_prices if price > current_price) / num_simulations
prob_target = sum(1 for price in final_prices if price > 195) / num_simulations

print(f"Probability of positive return: {prob_positive:.1%}")
print(f"Probability of reaching target: {prob_target:.1%}")
