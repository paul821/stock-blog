        "\n",
        "This report analyzes the competitive dynamics between Tesla and Ford in the electric vehicle (EV) market, specifically examining Ford's entry into the electric truck segment with the F-150 Lightning and Tesla's response with the Cybertruck. The global EV market reached 14 million units in 2023, representing 18% of all car sales worldwide and a 35% increase from 2022. Tesla maintains market leadership with 48% of US EV market share, while traditional automakers like Ford are transitioning from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis reveals distinct strategic approaches: Ford leveraged its legacy F-150 brand to target traditional truck buyers with practical, affordable electric alternatives, while Tesla maintained premium positioning with innovative design and higher pricing. Ford's F-150 Lightning, launched in 2021 at \\$39,974, aimed to bridge the gap between conventional trucks and EVs. Tesla's Cybertruck, initially announced in 2019 but delivered in 2023, positioned itself as a luxury, tech-forward alternative starting at \\$60,990.\n",
        "\n",
        "Results show mixed outcomes: Ford sold 24,149 Lightning units in 2023 but faced production challenges and inventory issues. Tesla's Cybertruck achieved third place in US EV sales by Q3 2024, demonstrating strong demand for its premium positioning despite significant price increases from initial projections."
